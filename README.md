# alphabetizer
A simple JavaScript script for beginners, which alphabetically orders given words or lines in ascending or descending order, which can be found in `alphabetizer_Script.js` file.

The script itself is built on a check-box based HTML page, where these checkboxes decide if the given text will be ordered line by line or word by word, and if it will be shown in ascending order or descending order.
