# Alphabetizer
A simple JavaScript script for beginners, which alphabetically orders given words or lines in ascending or descending order, and returns an array of ordered items, which can be found in `alphabetizer_Script.js` file. A live example can be found on `alphabetizer.co`.

The script itself is built on a radio box based HTML page, where these radio boxes decide if the given text will be ordered line by line or word by word, and if it will be shown in ascending order or descending order.
